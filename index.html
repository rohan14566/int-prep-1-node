    <h3>Q.1 what is node js</h3>
    <p>Node. js is a single-threaded, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for building fast and scalable server-side and networking applications. It runs on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, and it uses event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture, which makes it efficient and suitable for real-time applications.</p>

    <h3>Q.2 .What is NPM?</h3>
    <p>1. NPM stands for the node package manager, npm is used for node
dependency management.<br>
2. Most of the time, we use npm as a server-side node dependency tool<br>
3. NPM gets installed with NodeJs installation. NPM uses nested
dependencies, so we can use different versions of any module in our code.
4. Nested dependencies mean that any dependency is again dependent on
another dependency npm: It is a package manager for the JavaScript
programming language</p>

    <h3>Q.3 What are the modules in Node.js</h3>
    <p>In Node.js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicate
with an external application on the basis of their related functionality.<br>
➔ Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders.<br>
 Modules are of three types:<br>
1. Core Modules/Internal modules<br>
2. Local Modules/Custom modules<br>
3. Third-party Modules<br>
</p>

    <h3>Q.4 .What is the purpose of the module.exports?</h3>
    <p>➔ The module.exports is actually a property of the module object in node.js.
module. Exports is the object that is returned to the require() call.<br>
➔ By module.exports, we can export functions, objects, and their references
from one file and can use them in other files by importing them by require()
method. easy to maintain and manage the code base in different modules.</p>

    <h3>Q.5 .Difference between default export and named export.</h3>
    <p>Named Exports:<br> Named exports are useful to export several values.
During the import, it is mandatory to use the same name of the corresponding
object.<br>
Named exports allow us to share multiple objects, functions or variables from a
single file and were introduced with the release of ES2015.<br>
Default Exports:<br> Default exports are useful to export only a single object, function,
variable.<br> During the import, we can use any name to import.Exports without a
default tag are Named exports. Exports with the default tag are Default exports.<br>
default export:- Using Named and Default Exports at the same time: It is possibl</p>

    <h3>Q.6  How do you import any module in Node.js?</h3>
    <p>Importing a Module: We need to import the module to use the functions defined in
the imported module in another file. The result returned by require() is stored in a
variable which is used to invoke the functions using the dot notation.<br><br>
const f = require('./func')
</p>

    <h3>Q.7 . What are the different types of HTTP requests?</h3>
    <p>GET: GET request is used to read/retrieve data from a web server. <br>
POST: POST request is used to send data (file, form data, etc.) to the server.<br>
PUT: A PUT request is used to modify the data on the server. It replaces the entire
content at a particular location with data that is passed in the body payload.<br>
DELETE: A DELETE request is used to delete the data on the server at a specified
location.
</p>

    <h3>Q.8 .Explain the concept of middleware in Node.js</h3>
    <p>Middleware has the access to the request object, responses object, and next, it can
process the request before the server send a response. An Express-based
application is a series of middleware function calls.<br>
The next() function in the express is responsible for calling the next middleware
function if there is one.
